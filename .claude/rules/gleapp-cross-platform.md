# Cross-platform traps, each one measured

GLEAPP ships on Windows, macOS and Linux, with Windows on ARM planned. Every item below
bit for real during development and has a guard now. Keep the guards, and add to this
file when a new one shows up.

## Line endings are LF, enforced

Files written on Windows arrived CRLF and files written elsewhere LF, and a script that
normalized one on the way through produced a 738-line diff for a 17-line edit.
`.gitattributes` keeps text LF in the repository and on checkout, with wheels, the ONNX
model and images marked so normalization can never touch them. `tools/check_line_endings.sh`
fails the required test job if any tracked text file is stored otherwise, using git's own
classification, `git ls-files --eol`. If it flags a file: `git add --renormalize <file>`
and commit.

When a script edits a file, open it with `newline=''` so nothing is translated, and check
that the diff touches only the lines you meant. Content reading right is not evidence the
file is.

## A one-file build and a one-folder build share a name off Windows

Both are `dist/GLEAPP` on macOS and Linux, a file and a folder, and PyInstaller's
`--noconfirm` removes whatever is already there without a word. Measured: a `--onefile`
build on top of a folder build replaced 1,257 files with one, exit 0. In the signing
workflow that folder can be the signed build waiting for phase 2. `packaging/build.py`
refuses both directions before anything runs; `--clean` is the sanctioned way past it.

## Imports that exist on one platform must be conditional

`clr` (pythonnet, for WebView2) exists only on Windows. As an unconditional hidden import
it logged an ERROR on every macOS and Linux build. The spec adds it under
`sys.platform == "win32"`. `import webview` stays inside `desktop.main()` so importing
`gleapp.desktop` never needs a GUI library, which is what lets the `gleappGUI.py` shim be
tested without the desktop extra.

## One dependency needs a C compiler, and where

`pyliblzfse` publishes wheels for Windows x64 and macOS on Python 3.10 to 3.13 only, none
for 3.14 anywhere, and none for Linux ever. Its Windows wheels are vendored in `whl_files/`
with environment markers, the same mechanism iLEAPP uses, so Windows never compiles;
Linux, Windows on ARM and Python 3.14 on macOS build it from source. It decodes Apple's
LZFSE-compressed GPU textures and is reached only for that format. It is a hard
requirement on purpose: iLEAPP handles the same textures the same way.

## macOS specifics

PyInstaller strips signatures while it builds, its own log says so, so `codesign` runs
after phase 1 on the finished bundle, never before. The `.app` comes from a `BUNDLE` block
in the spec with identifier `org.leapp.gleapp.app`, the shape LAVA uses; the `.dmg` comes
from `hdiutil` and is verified before it is reported. No icon exists in `packaging/` yet,
on any platform; a `gleapp.icns` and a `gleapp.ico` there are picked up automatically.

## Headless smoke tests of the frozen binary

`desktop.main()` does not handle `--version`; `packaging/entrypoint.py` answers it before
the desktop shell is imported. `--texworker <in> <out> <max_side>` decodes an image inside
the frozen bundle with no window. Both are what CI uses to prove a build actually runs.

## Paths

Never publish an absolute path from the examiner's machine into a report or an export.
Use `os.path` and `pathlib`. A split on a hard-coded separator is the identity function on
the other platform, and a derived column that always equals its input is the tell.

## Full-file-system zips are staged flat and hashed, not mirrored

An extraction zip is a third source kind, `archive` (`gleapp/archive.py`). Members are
enumerated from the central directory, which took 0.1 to 1.7 seconds on 12 to 14 GiB
images, and every extension-less member is sniffed from its first 16 bytes straight from
the archive, because that is where the media hides: on one Android image 1,085 members
were media by extension and the sniff found 2,849 more.

What is staged is what is registered. Media is staged under `<case>/staged/` as
`<slug>/<2 hex>/<sha1 of the member path>.<ext>`; `path` is that file, `rel_path` is the
member path with the single root folder stripped, `orig_path` the member path as stored.
Flat and hashed for three measured reasons: this codebase has no Windows long-path
handling and members nest 20 levels deep; case-variant names cannot collide on a
case-insensitive volume; and a member name carrying control characters, which real iOS
zips have, never reaches the filesystem. Timestamps come from the zip's extended field
when present (every member on one Android image, none of the media on one iOS image)
and the DOS date otherwise; the case's `meta` table records which, per source, along
with the archive's own hash when a UFED `.ufd` sidecar sits beside it.

Staged files are kept so the viewer can open them; deleting the case folder deletes
them, and the source zip is never written to. An extraction surfaces app streaming
caches, ExoPlayer `.exo` fragments and the like, which are not standalone videos; the
pipeline reports them with its existing messages rather than silently dropping them.
